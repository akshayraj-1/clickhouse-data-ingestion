1. I have got an assignment to make a bidirectional tool for data ingestion between ClickHouse and flat files
2. Let me clear things:
   ClickHouse - Its like dbms but for large data, for connection we need jwt (from where and how idk)
   I have to make a web to act like bridge between flat file to click house and click house to flat file
   1. click house to flat file
   - user will select the table and records and convert it to flat file
   2. flat file to click house
   - user will upload the csv file and specify the deliminator and i have upload the data to the click house and report for success or failures
   am i wright? please match the requirements according to the assignment

3. Help me to setup a java project using gradle
4. Which one is best for creating java project maven or java
   I have prior knowledge of gradle (just syntax) because I have used in my android projects
5. Okay I want to keep things simple for now so I will go with gradle for this project
6. I have looked into the online spring initializer can I setup the spring boot in my existing java project without recreating the whole project
7. from where I can change the port of the spring boot app
8. In node we have routes and controllers how to do that in spring boot like I want to setup the index route and print some message to the client
9. I have made a test controller to put some test routes or mappings
10. I want ot implement a basic authentication system with jwt please guide me through the steps and dependencies I will need to add
11. Can I remove spring boot security dependency because its showing a default login screen whenever I am trying to access the api
12. I have implemented the user login signup using jwt now I want to implement some sort of middleware to check if the user is authenticated or not
    In node they are called middlewares but how can i do in spring
13. Okay Interceptors are like middlewares in spring boot
14. How can i add validation to the request body or user input
15. Okay but whats the diff between @NotBlank and @NotEmpty in the validation
16. How can i add exception handler for routes
17. You are using the dto in the service classes shouldn't we use the dto in the controller classes
18. Okay got it, but since my project is not big i will use the dto in the service classes as well
19. Now that i get the gist of the spring boot lets move to my assignment
    Do you know about ClickHouse?
20. Great my task is to make bidirectional tool for data ingestion between ClickHouse and flat files
    means user can transform data from flat files to ClickHouse and vice versa
    for that I need to create a web based app with interface to select source and destination
    and way to select columns to ingest
    I have looked into official library on github but I don't know how to use it
21. Okay let me see how to use it
22. The assignment is suggesting to use jwt for accessing the database means to connect with the database
    user will provide host, port and token to connect to the database but I have looked into the docs and the library
    the clickhouse do not supports jwt authentication it used username and password
23. Okay I will use username and password for now
24. I have found this method in the library when i was looking into it
    Client.Builder()
    .addEndpoint(Protocol.HTTP, connectRequest.getHost(), connectRequest.getPort(), isSecure)
    .setAccessToken("")
    .build();
    as you can see the library has method to use access token for database connection
    but I am confused since the clickhouse do not supports jwt auth
    whats the use of this

25. So i need to use self hosted clickhouse server
26. But this also supports username and password authentication
27. Do i need to create some sort of wrapper around this to support jwt auth
28. No i don't want to implement that in backend itself, is there any way to do that in the docker instance of the clickhouse
29. Okay but how can i add a proxy layer that will validate the request before sending it to the clickhouse
30. Why are you using lua and stuff can you make this more simple
31. first give me the directory structure
32. the container crashed and i tried but crashes every time
33. I have used the updated code but still not working its something with the lua in the nginx config file
34. I can't check logs because the container is not running
35. I think the problem is that the proxy pass is passing the request with the auth header
    how can i remove the auth header from the request before sending it to the clickhouse
36. token is handled through proxy layer and then automatically proxy passed to clickhouse server with username and password
    i am using authorization header for token verification may the clickhouse library methods used another format how can i see the request from the library like what are headers and body
37. I have a question since the connection info like host and port is provided at runtime by the user
    Suppose I have configured and connected to the clickhouse instance using that info how am I supposed to keep the clickhouse connected instance throughout the user session
    Do I need to connect to the clickhouse for every request of users except connect request (like getting or uploading records)
38. Since its not a production project can I maintain sessions (if its not too complicated in springboot framework)
    My use case is:
    The assignment suggests to take host, port and jwt from the user on selecting the source as ClickHouse but I think I am going to need these info every time no matter what is the source because I have to connect to the clickhouse either way (because bidirectional data transfer).
    So I am thinking to use the auth system here once user authenticate with these info they can skip these steps
